# Thames : WVR in a Pedal

Thames is an open-source midi instrument. It comes pre-loaded with some instruments, but it's easy to make your own too. You can even setup what the buttons and encoder do, and control the LEDs, by writting some custom Arduino code.

# Power
Thames takes between 6 and 9 VDC, with a center-negative PSU. Boss pedal style PSUs work perfectly.
